# Generation decisions — 2026-09-27 continuation

## Requested scope

Resume Bonsai and five Luna workers; investigate failures independently, improve agent usability, preserve data quality.
The explicit five-worker request supersedes HANDOVER's earlier two-worker limit. Allocation: folder 2, handoffs 2,
Bonsai rejection redo 1. Bonsai retains six slots. Training remains gated by the earlier explicit training instruction.

## Decisions and evidence

- Refreshed the isolated runner before starting collectors. Builds there and in the main checkout passed (Node and
  browser bundles). Runner refresh changes runtime provenance; finished compatible runs must be passed explicitly
  through `--reuse`/`--reuse-surfaces`, preserving original provenance. Do not silently relabel old trajectories.
- Added `snapshot_teacher_jobs.mjs` and used it in the redo loop: exports cover only the selected collector range,
  whereas a jobs directory can contain earlier ranges too. Three additional rejected programs were recovered from
  the 128 completed Bonsai results (redo queue 10 -> 13). Initial handover claim that exports update only at shutdown
  was incorrect: current collector merges after each completed job. Snapshotting addresses range omissions.
- Fixed admission's child attribution: a child capturing a whole collection was matched against every item's evidence
  in that collection. Identify children by instructions and argument observations, excluding captured declarations.
  Evidence explicitly in a child's instructions/arguments also counts as observed. On the fixed 31-result folder
  snapshot, 75 false missing-child-observation reasons disappear; admission stays 20/31 because real outcome
  failures remain. Regression checks include absent and unread children; both must still reject.
- No runtime tool surface or default changed yet. Avoid changing file-tool defaults before the planned measured probe.
- Found two Hotpot tasks where one retrieved article directly supports the answer but the hidden admission rubric
  requires both support articles. Keep them excluded pending a general evidence policy decision; do not erase
  evidence requirements just to increase acceptance.
- CoEdIT neutralization includes terse fragments whose need for edits is questionable (e.g. neutral headings).
  Token distance from a reference alone does not prove that an edit is needed. Keep failures excluded; inspect the
  source-selection policy before adding more neutralization data.

## Validation

Main build passed. 11 focused tests passed: curriculum admission/reference replay and atomic completed-job snapshot.
Re-audit: `runs/folder/gen1.admission.log`. No model training started.

- Added startup queue counts, provenance-mismatch notices and per-job completion logs. These are collector-only
  diagnostics, not model-visible prompt changes. Expanded collector/admission regression suite: 26/26 passed.
- Bonsai resumed with 59/75 selected results reused; the existing strict reuse checks require recollecting three
  additional older results. Luna redo reused all six existing results. Running collectors use the isolated runner;
  admission and diagnostic changes are in main and apply to audits now, collection on its next runner refresh.

## Continuation pipeline repairs

- Continuation now recognizes current `train-joint`, legacy `train-teacher`, and subsequent `train-correction`
  recipes. Rendering, audit, output paths, checkpoint initialization and original split registry follow the selected
  phase. Tests construct their recipe using the actual repository registry instead of a nonexistent temporary one.
- Materialized decisions now carry a compact final `outcome` verdict (`accepted`, `status`, optional oracle).
  The continuation validator required it but the materializer omitted it. Files and action ledgers are not duplicated.
- Materialization preserves the program's source groups as well as its own ID, so a handoff cannot acquire a fresh
  train/holdout assignment merely by getting a new task ID. Existing exported turns must be rematerialized to benefit;
  build v5 from raw trajectories, not concatenated old turn exports.
- Validation: Node + browser build; 41 focused Node tests; 10 Python improvement/continuation tests all pass,
  including a real frozen Node collector using local fixture HTTP models through prepare-correction. Tests do not
  launch GPU training. Logs: `runs/generation-{build,regression}.log`, `runs/improvement-regression.log`.

## Running and queued work

- Bonsai train4 collector PID 13007; redo follows that exact PID with 120-second intervals. Folder/handoff collectors
  use two Luna workers each; redo uses one. All use `/home/werg/natlang-runner/ts-host`, isolated from main rebuilds.
- `runs/folder/run-bonsai-probe.sh` waits for PID 13007, then runs `all`, `editor`, `files` sequentially on the same
  12 training cases (two from each of six directory families), with six Bonsai workers, seed 1201, 20 turns.
  It writes separate jobs/results/ledgers for each surface and logs to `runs/folder/bonsai-probe.log`.
  The untrained Spark comparison still needs the GPU after Bonsai work; no default surface decision yet.
- At the latest checkpoint: folder 35 completed (was 30), handoffs 68 (was 66), Bonsai 128 saved, redo 6 saved;
  collectors have live partial journals, and no `*.error.json` files in those four job directories.
- v5 assembly remains after train4/redo completes; include the new admission and materialization code in main.
  Probe and generation are asynchronous and are not claimed complete by these counts.

## 2026-09-28 morning: overnight audit and recovery

- User reduced Luna to **three total workers**, superseding five. Restart allocation: folder 1, handoffs 1, redo 1.
- Overnight: Bonsai train4 75/75 selected complete (141 saved over all historical ranges, 135 task-accepted).
  Folder 102/106 saved (70 task-accepted); updated admission is **67/102**. Handoffs 282/833 saved (116 task-accepted).
  Redo 12/13 saved; the last case exhausted rate-limit retries. Counts are task results, not all training admissions.
- Fixed a real export size limit: joining all folder trajectories into one JavaScript string failed above roughly
  512 MiB, stopped collection, and left obsolete per-job error reports even for saved results. Atomic result merge
  and snapshots now stream rows; manifest hashing streams bytes; admission reads and optionally writes one row at
  a time. Actual folder snapshot/export is 718,937,647 bytes and now succeeds; admission of all 102 rows succeeds.
- Dedicated updated runner: `/home/werg/natlang-generation-runner/ts-host`. Dependency links include both root and
  ts-host node_modules (initial missing root dependency link was detected and repaired before resuming requests).
- Handoff PID 8817 did not exit after several minutes following SIGTERM; stopped that exact PID and resumed its
  journals with one worker. Completed results were preserved. Graceful cancellation responsiveness needs follow-up.
- Bonsai probe's first surface saved 6/12, with six shared-context-limit failures. Resumed it with one worker to
  reduce concurrent KV pressure. A collector exit 2 (incomplete cases) now permits auditing and the next surface,
  instead of silently ending the entire comparison. Do not choose a default from this incomplete probe.
- Validation: Node/browser build passes; 27 collector, admission and streaming tests pass. Streaming producer
  failure preserves the prior output and removes its temporary file. Large real-data admission is checked above.

## 2026-09-28 midday: bounded Bonsai recovery; Luna stopped

- User stopped Luna entirely. Do not restart Luna or assume the earlier three-worker authorization still applies.
- Stopped probe launcher 27922 and collector 27924 (SIGTERM, then exact collector PID SIGKILL when it did not exit).
  The single-worker CUAD case had consumed hours and hundreds of child turns. Saved results/journals remain intact.
- Added collector flags `--model-concurrency` (shared across all ordinary root/child requests in a collector) and
  `--max-model-requests` (per-job new transport requests, including optional planning). Budget exhaustion leaves
  an explicit error and journal rather than an accepted training row. These flags currently do not govern a
  separately configured oracle judge; the recovery queue does not configure one.
- Added `scripts/run_bonsai_queue.py`: each case gets its own collector subprocess with a hard 600-second wall budget,
  SIGTERM then SIGKILL after 10 seconds if needed. Timed-out and failed cases are journaled and the queue advances.
  Restart skips finished attempts; reviewed retries need a new journal. Interruptions preserve partial journals.
  This is an operational collection limit; large cases are deferred, not mislabeled as model reasoning failures.
- Built `runs/bonsai-recovery/queue.jsonl` from cases with no saved result in their Luna jobs directories: 1 retry,
  1 folder case, 551 handoffs. Interleaves lanes and orders each by input size. Existing rejected results are not
  silently retried or admitted. Bonsai uses separate recovery job directories; model provenance stays accurate.
- Recovery runs on a frozen local runtime at `runs/bonsai-recovery/runtime`, independent of main rebuilds. Request
  concurrency 2, shared KV estimate 40000, request budget 128, per-call turn limit 20, transport retries 1.
  Entry exports contain only that case; gather full lane jobs with snapshot_teacher_jobs.mjs when auditing/building.
- The surface probe is deferred while useful unfinished cases progress. Its incomplete comparison cannot justify
  changing the default file tools. The large-case trace/paging behavior still needs further diagnosis.
- Validation: Node and browser build succeeded; all 15 collector tests passed outside the sandbox (its local HTTP
  fixture tests crashed under the restricted environment). Added root/child shared-budget regression, verifying no
  result is exported at exhaustion. Python watchdog regression passes: a noncooperative child is killed, the next
  case runs, and restart skips finished attempts. Live retry journal is advancing on Bonsai.
